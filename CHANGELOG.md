### Removed
- config file for spatie/laravel-permission; models being used in CRUDs are now defined in ```config/backpack/permissionmanager.php```;
- migrations, since they are provided by spatie/laravel-permission;


## [3.12.6] - 2018-10-16

### Fixed
- validation for unique email when updating a user;


## [3.12.5] - 2018-09-29

## [3.12.1] - 2018-06-19

### Added
- #159 - Italian translation, thanks to [Roberto Butti](https://github.com/roberto-butti);


## [3.12.0] - 2018-06-07

### Added
- support for ```spatie/laravel-permission``` v2.12;

### Removed
- support for ```spatie/laravel-permission``` v2.12;

### Notes
- the db structure has changed; because that's what spatie did between v1.4 and v2.12;
- there is no upgrade guide from spatie v1 to spatie v2; and after spending a lot of time on this, I understand why; it would have been way to difficult to create migrations for such an upgrade; especially for big projects, that might have other foreign keys to/from the old tables;
- as such, we didn't provide an upgrade guide either; people who use v1 will continue to use v1; people who start now will be using v2;
- if we do go through the upgrade ourselves at one point, we might provide an upgrade guide; if anybody, ever, creates an upgrade guide, please link to it on the README;
- since spatie/laravel-permission pushes breaking changes like crazy, and this package is pretty simple and does not need regular updates, I've decided to track spatie/laravel-permission's version; starting now; this new version will be 3.12 because it uses spatie/laravel-permission v2.12;
