  Hello there! Thanks for opening your first issue on this repo!


  Just a heads-up: **Here at Backpack we use Github Issues only for tracking bugs**. Talk about new features is also acceptable. This helps _a lot_ in keeping our focus on improving Backpack. **If you issue is not a bug/feature, please help us out by closing the issue yourself and posting in the appropriate medium (see below)**. If you're not sure where it fits, it's ok, a community member will probably reply to help you with that.


  Backpack communication mediums:
   - Bug Reports, Feature Requests - Github Issues (here);
   - Quick help (_How do I do X_) - [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/BackpackForLaravel/Lobby);
   - Long questions (_I have done X and Y and it won't do Z wtf_) - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel), using the ```backpack-for-laravel``` tag;


  Please keep in mind Backpack offers no official / paid support. Whatever help you receive here, on Gitter, Slack or Stackoverflow is thanks to our awesome _awesome_ community members, who give up some of their time to help their peers. If you want to join our community, just start pitching in. We take pride in being a welcoming bunch.


  Thank you!

  BOOM! Your first PR with us, thank you so much! Someone will take a look at it shortly.


  Please keep in mind that:
    - **if this constitutes a breaking change, it might take quite a while for this to get merged**; we try to emulate the Laravel release cycle as much as possible, so developers can upgrade both software once; this means a new big release every ~6 months;
    - **even if it's a non-breaking change, it might take a few days/weeks for the PR to get merged**; unless it's a no-brainer, **we like to have some community feedback on new features, before we merge them**; this leads to higher-quality code, in the end; we learnt this the hard way :-)
    - **not all PRs get merged**; sometimes we just have to hold out new features, to keep the packages lean; sometimes we don't include features that only apply to niche use cases;
    - **we're not perfect**; if you think we're wrong, call us out on it; but in a kind way :-) we all make mistakes, best we learn from them and build better software together;


  Thank you!
