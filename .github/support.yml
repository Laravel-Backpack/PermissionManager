  Oups!


  Looks like this is a support request, not a bug/feature. **Could you please [repost on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel), using the ```backpack-for-laravel``` tag**?


  Background: **Here at Backpack we use Github Issues only for tracking bugs and features**, not individual implementation issues. This helps _a lot_ in keeping our focus on improving Backpack. Thanks a lot for understanding!


  Here are all the Backpack communication mediums:
   - Long questions (_I have done X and Y and it won't do Z wtf_) - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel), using the ```backpack-for-laravel``` tag; this is recommended for most questions, since other developers can then find the answer on a simple Google search; also, people get points for answering - and who doesn't like StackOverflow points?!
   - Quick help (_How do I do X_) - [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/BackpackForLaravel/Lobby);
   - Bug Reports, Feature Requests - Github Issues (here);

  Please keep in mind Backpack offers no official / paid support. Whatever help you receive here, on Gitter, Slack or StackOverflow is thanks to our awesome _awesome_ community members, who give up some of their time to help their peers. If you want to join our community, just start pitching in. We take pride in being a welcoming bunch.


  Thank you!
